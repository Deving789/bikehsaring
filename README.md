Using tableau to analyze bikeshare data in nyc

# Overview of our Analysis

The purpose of our project is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for a different city(which the customer is requesting). One of the key factors we need to look at is tripduration. Finding out how long the trips are in the month of August will give us a good analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are the most popular times to rent a bike. Before we do any of this there needs to be a change made in the csv to change the column that records the trip duration in seconds to hours, minutes and seconds. Once this was completed I uploaded the new CSV into tableau with the converted tripduration column.

# Results:

Using tableau I created 7 different visulizations using the total number of trips, the types of users and the trip duration. Here's what we found:

- There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.

- From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.

- There is a peak number of users who rent their bike for 5-6 hour trips.

-The largest number of individuals happen to be male, the women users dont have as large of a peak and unkown users do not have a peak for tripduration.

- If you look at my trips per weekday(by hour) you can see that Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike.
